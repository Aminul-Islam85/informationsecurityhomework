# Hello MarkDown

It my first try with MarkDown

## How this work

It is really nice to work with text indenting. 

### javaScript Code 


    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p>In this example, x is defined as a variable.
Then, x is assigned the value of 6:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x;
x = 6;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>
